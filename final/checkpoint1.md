IDEA


USER STORIES: (aka the "Who" and "Why")
At least 2 examples describing who would be motivated to use your app (it's okay to provide more than 2!)
Example: (Bird Watching App) "As a bird watcher, I want to see where the rarest birds have been sighted."
Example: (Quick Recording App) "As a musician, I want to quickly share audio recordings with a remote collaborator."

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: (aka the "How")
At least 2 features described (it's okay to provide more than 2)
Example: (Bird Watching App) "When the user enters zip code and selects 'Rare' category, the app will display a list of rare bird sightings nearby."
Example: (Quick Recording App) "When the user selects 'Record button', the app will record with the mic, uploading to the shared drive."

FRAMEWORKS, APIs, and DATA:
It's okay to just pick some as placeholders for now (e.g. just pick one since it looks cool, but perhaps swap out later)
See Technical Requirements for more hints on the 4 total framework(s) / API(s) / data source(s) / backend(s)
Example: (Bird Watching App) "Bulma CSS, Leaflet Maps API, Bird types API, Airtable backend for data"
Example: (Quick Recording App) "Tone.js Audio framework, Cloudinary API for playing audio, Dropbox API,  Pusher for chat"

MOCK UPS:
Create mockups of main pages (ideally, EVERY page!)
Hand-drawn and photographed with your phone is okay - just keep it legible!
Also okay: Using an image editor or other design software to create a mock-up (see below)

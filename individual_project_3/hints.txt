Hint 1: Think about creating functions for "correct" and "incorrect",
and connecting them to the buttons.

Hint 2: Think about creating variables to count correctCount and
incorrectCount, and using "correctCount++" etc to increase them

Hint 3: Think about creating variables to count lives and and using
"lives--" to decrease them.

Hint 4: Think about using querySelector and innerHTML to update the page
with your various count variables.

Hint 5: The hardest part might be "GAME OVER" and "YOU WIN". This will
require an "if" along with using querySelector. If you are stuck with
this, see the hint code snippets at the bottom.
